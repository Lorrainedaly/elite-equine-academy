The Elite Equine Academy website is a site aimed at showjumping riders looking for a trainer/trainers to increase their skills to be able to progress with their riding and the training of their horses on the showjumping circuit.

Users of this website will be able to find out about the different types of training that is available at the academy, our facilities, they will be able to see images of our past and present students in action and they will be able to contact us to make general enquiries or enquire about any of our  courses.

[You can view the live project here.](https://lorrainedaly.github.io/elite-equine-academy/) 

The website is designed to be responsive and accessable on a wide range of devices, making it easy to navigate for all users.

Currently the images are very large causing a delay with loading the pages, this is effecting the performance of my site and will need to be fixed.
